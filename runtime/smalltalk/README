Set of VagrantFiles to setup VMs (virtual machines),
running the OpenIndiana operating system, for running Squeak or Cuis images.

See https://www.vagrantup.com for more info on vagrant.

See https://www.openindiana.org/ for info on OpenIndiana.

See http://squeak.org/ and http://opensmalltalk.org for Squeak Smalltalk.
For Cuis see http://cuis-smalltalk.org/ 

There are directories for Squeak classic (version 1, 2, 3 and 4)
and Squeak OpenSmalltalk (version 5, 6) those are different Smalltalk images.

The directory "squeak" sets up a VM for squeak classic.

The directories "cog-spur" and "stack-spur" setup VMs for OpenSmalltalk Spur based Smalltalk systems Squeak 6.0 alpha and Squeak 5.

The directory "cuis" sets up a "cog-spur" VM for running Cuis images.

Assuming that "vagrant" is installed,

	vagrant up

will deploy an instance of the OpenIndiana operating system for Squeak.

Once finished, login with :

	vagrant ssh

This should set the $DISPLAY using X11 forwarding over ssh.

Check with echo $DISPLAY.

The various Smalltalk systems use a X11 display module to display to X11.

	inisqueak

This will initialize (download) the Squeak images and run squeak.

It will also download the Squeak sources.

See "man inisqueak" for more info.

You only have to run "inisqueak" the first time, later just run "squeak" :

	squeak squeak.image

or simply

	squeak

See "man squeak" for more info.

For Cuis a script is provided in the VM to git clone Cuis:

	sh ./clone-cuis

This will clone the Cuis images.

	cd Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev

Either run the image immediately or first copy it to squeak.image :

	squeak Cuis5.0-????.image

or

	cp Cuis5.0-????.image squeak.image
	cp Cuis5.0-????.changes squeak.changes
	squeak

The operating system can be updated by "pkg update".

This will update the squeak VM but not the Squeak images.

For updating Squeak images, open the File menu and choose Update ...

Choose "Save and quit" to write the Squeak updates to the image.
